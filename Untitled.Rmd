Pathways to Graduation
========================================================

We present a new visualization that will assist in understanding where and how students fall off-track on their path from middle school through high school graduation

```{r}
require(dplyr)
starting_grade <- filter(tables2007_2008$person_annual, grade == 8)
# Check how many of these are first-time eighth graders
table(starting_grade$sasid %in% filter(tables2006_2007$person_annual,
                                       grade == 8))
# Check how many students were in the district the prior year
table(starting_grade$sasid %in% tables2006_2007$person_annual$sasid)

# Build cohort for predictive model
source('cohort_8th_model.R')


```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}
plot(cars)
```
