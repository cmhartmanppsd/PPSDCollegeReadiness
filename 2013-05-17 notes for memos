  * Students who repeat 9th grade have a wide range of graduation prediction. (new indicator is high probability, but repeats 9th grade)
  * Virtually no one who repeats with a low predicted graduation graduates.
  * Students with >50% predicted likelihood of graduating but repeat a grade are almost as likely to graduated as those with <50% (30% v. 20%)

What do the quarter 1 GPAs look like for the high potential repeaters? Where are the high potential repeaters in schools?

Success transition is critical.
First quarter GPA is a triangulation of this.
Are there any more "critical" times than this in high school?
Slice and dice.
